## First Line Troubleshooting

Check runbook.md logs on [Splunk](https://financialtimes.splunkcloud.com/en-US/app/search/runbooksmd?form.field1.earliest=-60m%40m&form.field1.latest=now). This highlights all of the recent errors in production. Check if there is a recent build that failed using [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Financial-Times/runbook.md).

## Architecture

The user provides the content of a RUNBOOK.MD and its systemCode via a AWS Serverless Lambda GUI form (later to be an auto connection to the Change Request API) . On form submission control is passed to a second lambda which calls a runbook parser library, the SOS /Validate endpoint and, if successful, a PATCH request to Biz Ops REST API.
